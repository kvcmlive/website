Every weekend, KVCM brings you SHUT UP AND TALK LIVE!, a music-talk show where Alex (Ms.PeanutGallery) chooses an artist, genre or label and delves into their trajectory. Sometimes we focus on the artist’s style and select a handful of songs that either inspired them to craft their sound or were a direct result of their musical influence. Sometimes we go beyond names as we explore record labels and upcoming genres that you MUST know about. Now including segments like “Stalky Talky”, “Extra! Extra! Tweet All About It”, “Nevermind The Fresh Linen! Here’s The Freshest Music” and many others. Tune in!
