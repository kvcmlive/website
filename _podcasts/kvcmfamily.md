The KVCM Family Podcast is an idea that was developed from the Fall 2020 LAVC Broadcasting All-Stars who have managed to be creative and current during the pandemic. The Podcast has a different host each week and varying subject matter depending on what is on the minds of our advanced KVCM.Live student staff.
