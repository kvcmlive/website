The LAVC Academic Resource Center has partnered with KVCM Monarch Radio to present a college podcast called the Valley College Connection.

Hosted by John Kawai, professor of mathematics, and Scott Weigand, professor of English, this podcast features engaging conversations about success with educators, students and alumni.

Each week, they sit down with a different guest to find out ways they have had to plan, persevere, and overcome to be where they are now. The show also highlights resources and services that are working to make a difference at Valley College.
